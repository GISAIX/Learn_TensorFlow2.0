# Get started with tf.kreas

This is the implementation of several computer vision cases based in ```tf.keras```.With these examples, you can easily get started with ```tf.keras```.

**Including**:

* Linear regression.
* Nonlinear regression.
* Mnist dnn (train acc:99.2%).
* Mnist cnn (train acc:99.8% after 100 epoches).
* Use ImageDataGenerator to implement data enhancement.
* Finetune vgg16 to implement cat VS dog (train acc:91.5% after 50 epoches).
