# TensorFlow_and_Keras_notes

**This series is about learning notes and code records for Tensorflow/Keras.**

----------------------

In order to run the code in this repository, you should install **TensorFlow** and **Keras** in advance using the following commands in your terminal:
in python3 if you have gpu:
```shell
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
pip3 install keras
```
or in anaconda if you have gpu:
```shell
conda install tensorflow-gpu 
conda install keras
```
else 
```shell
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install keras
```
or in anaconda:
```shell
conda install tensorflow 
conda install keras
```
Having a GPU greatly speeds up your model training. Of course, without a gpu, these codes can also run.☺☺☺
