# TensorFlow_and_Keras_notes

**This series is about learning notes and code records for Tensorflow/Keras.**

----------------------

In order to run the code in this repository, you should install **TensorFlow** and **Keras** in advance using the following commands in your terminal:

run
```shell
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
pip3 install keras
```
if you use native pyhon,and run
```shell
conda install tensorflow-gpu 
conda install keras
```
if you use anaconda.

Having a GPU greatly speeds up your model training but it is not necessary, Of course, without a gpu, these codes can also run.
